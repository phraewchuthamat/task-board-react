## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality
- **Drag & Drop:** Fully interactive board using `@dnd-kit`. Supports **reordering** tasks within columns and **moving** tasks between columns with smooth animations.
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks with real-time UI updates.
- **Search & Filter:** Instant search by title/description and filter by priority (Low, Medium, High).

### 🎨 User Experience (UX)
- **Jira-like Layout:** Fixed viewport height with independent internal scrolling for columns and horizontal scrolling for the board.
- **Snap Scrolling:** CSS Scroll Snap implementation for a native-app feel on touch devices.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** System-aware theme switching with persistent preference.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Instant language switching (English/Thai) without page reload using React Context.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach, optimized for phones, tablets, and desktops.

### 💾 Data Persistence
- **Local Storage:** All data (Tasks, Theme, Language) is persisted locally. Data remains available after a page refresh.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights (Why I built it this way)

### 1. Architecture & State Management
- **Context API + useReducer:** Implemented a centralized state management system (`TaskContext`) to handle complex logic separately from UI components.
- **Custom Hooks:** Logic is abstracted into reusable hooks like `useBoardDrag`, `useTaskModal`, and `useLanguage` to maintain **Separation of Concerns**.

### 2. TypeScript Integration
- Fully typed codebase (Interfaces for `Task`, `Column`, `Priority`).
- Strict type checking to prevent runtime errors and improve code maintainability.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **React.memo:** Used on `TaskCard` and `TaskColumn` to prevent unnecessary re-renders during drag operations.
- **Event Delegation:** Optimized touch/click sensors in `dnd-kit` to handle conflict between dragging and button clicking (e.g., Delete button on card).

### 4. Accessibility & Polish
- **Accessible Colors:** High contrast colors for text and badges.
- **Confirm Dialogs:** Defensive UX design to prevent accidental data loss.
